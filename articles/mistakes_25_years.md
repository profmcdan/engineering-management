# Mistakes of the First Twenty-five Years (A Condensed Version)

*[Full text here](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1989.html)*

To quote Robert Benchley, "Having a dog teaches a boy 
fidelity, perseverance, and to turn around three times before 
lying down." Such are the shortcomings of experience. 
Nevertheless, it's a good idea to review past mistakes before 
committing new ones. So let's take a quick look at the last 25 
years.

My first mistake, of course, was in buying control of 
Berkshire. Though I knew its business - textile manufacturing - 
to be unpromising, I was enticed to buy because the price looked 
cheap. Stock purchases of that kind had proved reasonably 
rewarding in my early years, though by the time Berkshire came 
along in 1965 I was becoming aware that the strategy was not 
ideal.

If you buy a stock at a sufficiently low price, there will 
usually be some hiccup in the fortunes of the business that gives 
you a chance to unload at a decent profit, even though the long-
term performance of the business may be terrible. I call this the 
"cigar butt" approach to investing. A cigar butt found on the 
street that has only one puff left in it may not offer much of a 
smoke, but the "bargain purchase" will make that puff all profit.

Unless you are a liquidator, that kind of approach to buying 
businesses is foolish. First, the original "bargain" price 
probably will not turn out to be such a steal after all. In a 
difficult business, no sooner is one problem solved than another 
surfaces -  never is there just one cockroach in the kitchen. 
Second, any initial advantage you secure will be quickly eroded 
by the low return that the business earns. For example, if you 
buy a business for $8 million that can be sold or liquidated for 
$10 million and promptly take either course, you can realize a 
high return. But the investment will disappoint if the business 
is sold for $10 million in ten years and in the interim has 
annually earned and distributed only a few percent on cost. Time 
is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the 
mediocre.

You might think this principle is obvious, but I had to 
learn it the hard way - in fact, I had to learn it several times 
over. Shortly after purchasing Berkshire, I acquired a Baltimore 
department store, Hochschild Kohn, buying through a company 
called Diversified Retailing that later merged with Berkshire. I 
bought at a substantial discount from book value, the people were 
first-class, and the deal included some extras - unrecorded real 
estate values and a significant LIFO inventory cushion. How could 
I miss? So-o-o - three years later I was lucky to sell the 
business for about what I had paid. After ending our corporate 
marriage to Hochschild Kohn, I had memories like those of the 
husband in the country song, "My Wife Ran Away With My Best 
Friend and I Still Miss Him a Lot."

I could give you other personal examples of "bargain-
purchase" folly but I'm sure you get the picture:  It's far 
better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair 
company at a wonderful price. Charlie understood this early; I 
was a slow learner. But now, when buying companies or common 
stocks, we look for first-class businesses accompanied by first-
class managements.

That leads right into a related lesson: Good jockeys will 
do well on good horses, but not on broken-down nags. Both 
Berkshire's textile business and Hochschild, Kohn had able and 
honest people running them. The same managers employed in a 
business with good economic characteristics would have achieved 
fine records. But they were never going to make any progress 
while running in quicksand. 

I've said many times that when a management with a 
reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation 
for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that 
remains intact. I just wish I hadn't been so energetic in 
creating examples. My behavior has matched that admitted by  Mae 
West: "I was Snow White, but I drifted."

A further related lesson: Easy does it. After 25 years of 
buying and supervising a great variety of businesses, Charlie and 
I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems. What 
we have learned is to avoid them. To the extent we have been 
successful, it is because we concentrated on identifying one-foot 
hurdles that we could step over rather than because we acquired 
any ability to clear seven-footers.

The finding may seem unfair, but in both business and 
investments it is usually far more profitable to simply stick 
with the easy and obvious than it is to resolve the difficult. On 
occasion, tough problems must be tackled as was the case when we 
started our Sunday paper in Buffalo. In other instances, a great 
investment opportunity occurs when a marvelous business 
encounters a one-time huge, but solvable, problem as was the case 
many years back at both American Express and GEICO. Overall, 
however, we've done better by avoiding dragons than by slaying 
them. 

My most surprising discovery: the overwhelming importance in 
business of an unseen force that we might call "the institutional 
imperative." In business school, I was given no hint of the 
imperative's existence and I did not intuitively understand it 
when I entered the business world. I thought then that decent, 
intelligent, and experienced managers would automatically make 
rational business decisions. But I learned over time that isn't 
so. Instead, rationality frequently wilts when the institutional 
imperative comes into play.

For example: (1) As if governed by Newton's First Law of 
Motion, an institution will resist any change in its current 
direction; (2) Just as work expands to fill available time, 
corporate projects or acquisitions will materialize to soak up 
available funds; (3) Any business craving of the leader, however 
foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and 
strategic studies prepared by his troops; and (4) The behavior of 
peer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting 
executive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.

Institutional dynamics, not venality or stupidity, set 
businesses on these courses, which are too often misguided. After 
making some expensive mistakes because I ignored the power of the 
imperative, I have tried to organize and manage Berkshire in ways 
that minimize its influence. Furthermore, Charlie and I have 
attempted to concentrate our investments in companies that appear 
alert to the problem.

After some other mistakes, I learned to go into business 
only with people whom I like, trust, and admire. As I noted 
before, this policy of itself will not ensure success: A second-
class textile or department-store company won't prosper simply 
because its managers are men that you would be pleased to see 
your daughter marry. However, an owner - or investor - can 
accomplish wonders if he manages to associate himself with such 
people in businesses that possess decent economic 
characteristics. Conversely, we do not wish to join with managers 
who lack admirable qualities, no matter how attractive the 
prospects of their business. We've never succeeded in making a 
good deal with a bad person.

Some of my worst mistakes were not publicly visible. These 
were stock and business purchases whose virtues I understood and 
yet didn't make. It's no sin to miss a great opportunity outside 
one's area of competence. But I have passed on a couple of really 
big purchases that were served up to me on a platter and that I 
was fully capable of understanding. For Berkshire's shareholders, 
myself included, the cost of this thumb-sucking has been huge.

Our consistently-conservative financial policies may appear 
to have been a mistake, but in my view were not. In retrospect, 
it is clear that significantly higher, though still conventional, 
leverage ratios at Berkshire would have produced considerably 
better returns on equity than the 23.8% we have actually 
averaged. Even in 1965, perhaps we could have judged there to be 
a 99% probability that higher leverage would lead to nothing but 
good. Correspondingly, we might have seen only a 1% chance that 
some shock factor, external or internal, would cause a 
conventional debt ratio to produce a result falling somewhere 
between temporary anguish and default.

We wouldn't have liked those 99:1 odds - and never will. A 
small chance of distress or disgrace cannot, in our view, be 
offset by a large chance of extra returns. If your actions are 
sensible, you are certain to get good results; in most such 
cases, leverage just moves things along faster. Charlie and I 
have never been in a big hurry: We enjoy the process far more 
than the proceeds - though we have learned to live with those 
also.
